Semantic search allows computers to understand the meaning behind user queries rather than relying only on exact keyword matching. Using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), we can build a high-performance system that searches through hundreds or even thousands of documents by meaning and not just by text overlap. This approach enables smarter, faster and more context-aware information retrieval.
